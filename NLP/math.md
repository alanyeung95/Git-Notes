## Perplexity
Perplexity is an interesting measure of how well you're predicting something

Note that a human, after seeing that the first number is 1 and the second is 2, might guess that the third is 3, and so on. So a human is a better predictor than a die, and would have a lower perplexity

## Principal components analysis 
For dimensionality reduction

When you have a representation of your words in a high dimensional space.

You could use an algorithm like PCA
to get a representation on a vector space with fewer dimensions.

If you want to visualize your data,
you can get a reduced representation with three or fewer features.
