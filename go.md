# Golang

## Advantage
1. Coding sytle easy to maintain
    1. starting line of if brackets
    2. force removement of unsed code/import lib
2. Lower barrier of using concurrency (compare with other language)
    1. goroutines & channel
3. Golang has a garbage collector (compare with C++)
4. Has pointer to allocate memory in a better way (even we can use `unsafe` pkg to do pointer arithmetic)

## Disadvantage
1. Don't have ternary operator

2. OOP features
   1. Support polymorphism https://play.golang.org/p/6Ip9scm4c3
   2. Not support inheritance (no class to extend) unless we implement it with special way
