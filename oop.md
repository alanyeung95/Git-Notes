# ABSTRACTION and ENCAPSULATION

Abstraction is focused mainly on what should be done while Encapsulation is focused on how it should be done. 

## Abstraction
It is an act of representing only the essential things without including background details. (e.g. Interface). Abstraction hides complexity by giving you a more abstract picture.

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation hides implementation details, group code and data into a single entity. Accessing those info with getter and setter

Every function is an encapsulation. 

## implementation difference
- We can implement abstraction using abstract class and interfaces.	
- Whereas encapsulation can be implemented using by access modifier i.e. private, protected and public.

## Design difference
- In abstraction, implementation complexities are hidden using abstract classes and interfaces.	
- While in encapsulation, the data is hidden using methods of getters and setters.

# virtual functions
In Java, all non-static methods are by default "virtual functions." Only methods marked with the keyword final, which cannot be overridden, along with private methods, which are not inherited, are non-virtual.
